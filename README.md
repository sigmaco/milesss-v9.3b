## About Miles Sound System

The **Miles Sound System (MSS)** is one of the most influential audio middleware libraries in the history of PC and console gaming. Originally developed by **John Miles**, then embraced by **RAD Game Tools**, MSS powered audio in thousands of commercial titles across DOS, Windows, PlayStation, Xbox, Dreamcast, GameCube, and more. If you've ever played a game between 1995 and 2010, there's a good chance you've "heard" the work of Miles.

Miles Sound System was used in over 7,000 titles, ranging from AAA franchises to indie classics. Understanding how MSS functioned gives insight into:

- Middleware engineering practices from the late '90s and early 2000s  
- Cross-platform audio abstraction layers  
- The evolution of audio codecs, 3D sound, and streaming  
- Licensing and binary distribution models  
- Challenges in preserving proprietary software  

The version 9.3 represents one of last legacy release of Miles Sound System before its phase-out. The Archivo has archived and released this version for **educational**, **preservation**, and **modding community** purposes.

## Project Goals

- **Education:** Provide a real-world case study in audio middleware design and legacy software engineering.
- **Preservation:** Ensure the survival and accessibility of historically significant software for future generations.
- **Modding Support:** Empower community modders to restore or enhance audio in classic games.
- **Collaboration:** Invite a community of enthusiasts, educators, and developers to contribute to ongoing preservation efforts.
